This example demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to directly manipulating instance variables. While functional, it's generally bad practice because it circumvents the intended encapsulation and data access methods.  This can create maintainability issues and makes debugging harder.  The preferred approach is to use accessor methods (getters and setters) to manage instance variables.
